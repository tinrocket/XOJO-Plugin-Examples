Eye Control Plugin Read Me
==========================

File list:
	+ Test
		- EyeControlTest.rbp -- A sample Real Studio project to test the Eye Control Plugin
	- 0.bmp -- This is the icon that appears in the IDE's Control Palette list
	- EyeControlPlugin.cpp -- complete source of Eye Control Plugin
	- Makefile_Linux -- Linux makefile
	- Visual Studio -- folder with VS 2015 solution
	- Xcode -- folder with Xcode solution
	- Read Me.txt -- the file you're reading


How to build on macOS (10.15+):
1. Open the EyeControl Xcode project
2. Build
3. Locate EyeControl.dylib

How to build on Windows (with Visual Studio):
1. Open the EyeControl.sln in Visual Studio 2022
2. Build solution
3. EyeControl.dll should be created which dynamically links against the MSVCRT runtimes which is appropriate for 2022r1
   since we include these runtimes with each build.  However, for older versions of RB you may want to consider statically linking
   these libraries instead, refer to the "Code Generation -> Runtime Library" section of the project settings

How to build on Linux (with g++):
1. Launch Terminal and cd into the Eye Control directory
2. @prompt> make -fMakefile_Linux all
3. EyeControl.so should be created

You can package the plugin for testing by creating a new directory name “EyeControl.xojo_plugin” structured like the following 
Include only the portions you need
